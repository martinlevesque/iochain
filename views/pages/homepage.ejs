        <h3>Typical cryptocurrency payment gateways add fees for each transaction. We don't.</h3>
        <p>
Probably you heard from a blockchain enthusiast that cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. are one of the most significant money revolution since the past century as it is
distributed, fast, and nobody can take control of the market and manipulate it. We also believe it.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, typical cryptocurrency payment gateways take a <strong>percentage %</strong> of every sale you do.
          Transaction fees are required so that the network (miners) can verify transactions. We don't deny it.
          However, we believe no other fee should be added. That's why we created <strong>ioChain</strong>.

            <h4>Create Your Application</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Creating your application takes 2 minutes. First you will have to provide a name,
              an HTTP callback URL and email so that we can notify you on every event related to your transactions.
              You can also provide a <strong>set of custom parameters</strong>, such as the <strong>User ID</strong>
              which is used to add metadata on the transaction.

            <h4>Clients Make Payments Directly to your Wallet</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Transactions are not processed to our wallets - they are done directly to your existing wallet(s).
              You just need to enter your public address in our dashboard to get started receiving payments.
              No manual payout required.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Using the custom parameters (e.g., User ID) you configured, we match
              them to the processed transactions. You get notified via email and to your HTTP API (endpoint)
              with detailed information on the transaction. You can efficiently match your client to
              the transaction in order to operate your web app and process orders.

        <p>
          Then, you will be able to genarate payment links and copy them to your website and start receiving payments.
          That's it!
